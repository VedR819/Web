            What is Parkinson's Disease?
        </h2>    


        <p class="definition-text">
            Parkinson’s Disease can be classified as a mental disorder. Those who have Parkinson’s Disease continuously lose neurons in their brains over time.
            It’s important to note that these are not any kind of neurons. The neurons lost are a special kind of neuron called Dopamine Neurons.
            Parkinson's Disease affects your brain and the nervous system. Other body parts that are controlled by nerves are also affected
            by Parkinson's Disease.
        </p>    
   
        <h2 class="dopamine-title">Dopamine</h2>
        <p class="dopamine-text">
            Dopamine is a chemical that is released by Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine is most commonly known for being responsible for our happiness and our motivation.
            However, dopamine is also responsible for movement. Dopamine neurons can be found in a part of our brain called the “substantia nigra”.
            <br><br><br>
            Since Parkinson’s Disease causes its patients to lose dopamine neurons over time, this causes there to be less dopamine in our brains.
            This lack of dopamine causes a patient’s movement to be limited and is the root cause for Parkinson Disease symptoms.

        <p class="cause-text">
            There are multiple reasons why people get Parkinson’s Disease.
            Those reasons all boil down to these factors:

        <h3 class="gender-title">Causes: Gender</h3>


        <p class="gender-text">
            Men have a higher chance of getting Parkinson’s Disease compared to women.
            The ratio is almost 2:1.

        <h3 class="age-title">Causes: Age</h3>
        <p class="age-text">
            It’s important to note that young people rarely ever get Parkinson’s Disease. As seen with the graph to the left, the older you get, the chance of getting Parkinson’s Disease increases.
            Most people with Parkinson’s Disease are about 60 years old. Some are older.
