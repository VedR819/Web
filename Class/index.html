        Everybody has their own preferences. They either love a class, hate a class, or are fine with it.
        I have a good understanding on which classes I like and which classes I do not like. Today, I will
        share my opinion on the classes I have, starting from least favorite to my most favorite class.
    </p>
</div>





<div class="ace-text">
    <h2>7. ACE</h2>
    <p>
        This class had to be at the bottom of my class tier list. This technically doesn't even count as a class.
        My teacher is super nice but you don't do much in that class. You just wait until your nest class starts.
    </p>
</div>




<div class="pe-text">
    <h2>6. P.E.</h2>
    <p>
        Besides from ACE, this is my least favorite class. This is because of two reasons. First, I don't like the teachers.
        They would say I did something wrong when I didn't do anything.
    </p>
    <div class="soccer-image">
        <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0337/7469/products/Soccer-Ball-on-Green-Grass-Wall-Mural_252de950-5e87-4f6c-8a13-7955594cf464.jpeg?v=1628780352" alt="Soccer Ball" style="width:200px; height:150px;">
    </div>
    <p>




        Second, we spend most of our time stretching instead of
        doing things like soccer or football. Other than that, this class is really solid.
    </p>
</div>




<div class="english-text">
    <h2>5. English</h2>
    <p>
        I feel really bad for doing this, but it had to be done. The teacher (Mr. Shaprio) is a great teacher. He teaches well and his
        grading style is really nice.
    </p>
    <div class="bookshelf-image">
        <img src="https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/26/81/bookshelf-background-bookcase-with-books-vector-34852681.jpg" alt="Bookshelf" style="width:100px; height:100px">
    </div>
        <p>
           However, the class is just boring. This has nothing to do with the teacher. English, overall, is a boring
           subject for me.
    </p>
</div>




<div class="spanish-text">
    <h2>4. Spanish</h2>
    <div class="hola-image">
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/SzN3D5vf8Q8AAAAC/hola.gif" alt="hola-image" style="width:495px; height:400px">
    </div>
    <p>
        The teacher is really nice in this class but I just don't like the subject. I feel like learning Spanish is a little pointless
        so that's why it's ranked so low. If this was ranked on teachers, this class would be on my Top 3 list.

<div class="code-text">
    <h2>3. Exploring Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        This class is a solid class. Alot of my good friends are in this class and coding is fun in general. The teacher is also really nice.
    </p>
    <div class="computer-image">
        <img src="http://www.allentownpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Computer-Basics.png" alt="computer-image" style="width: 100px; height: 100px">
    </div>
    <p>
        The only reason this is lower than usual is not because the class is neccesarily bad, it's just that I think that there are better classes
        than this. Other than this, this class is great!
    </p>
</div>


<div class="math-text">
    <h2>2. Math</h2>
    <p>I put that class at number two because I love math. The teacher is also really nice and makes the subject as intresting as possible.</p>
    <div class="math-image">
        <img src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iStock-mathproblems-1200x800.jpg" alt="math-image" style="width: 200px; height: 150px">
    </div>
    <p>
        This is impressive because math can get a little boring and repetative at times. I also like this class because the grading system isn't as bad as
        other class.
    </p>

<div class="chemistry-text">
    <h1>1. Chemistry</h1>
    <p>This is my favorite class because of three main reasons. The first reason is the teacher. Mr. Nebens may seem scary at times
        but he is actually really nice to his class. He also teaches the subject really well. 
    </p>
    <div class="chemistry-image">
        <img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/52/90/05/360_F_552900530_D4WF1c3zGsvIGfLgKaRBrEmbvPlk6O6E.jpg" alt="chemistry-image" style="width: 150px; height: 100px">
    </div>
    <p>
        The second reason is that chemistry is really intresting. We do alot of labs and all of them were fun to do with my friends. Overall, Chemistry is
        the best class I am currently in and I find it really fun.
    </p>
